Résumé
======

I've uploaded my personal résumé as an example for those that might want to try to format their résumé with LaTeX. There is quite a bit more flexibility than templates in say, Microsoft Word, and learning LaTeX is a great skill for composing other documents as well. I've experimented with a variety of ideas and things that I've learned over the years, so this is probably not the most beautiful document, but I do like how it has turned out! Let me know if I can clarify anything or if you have any suggestions for me!
